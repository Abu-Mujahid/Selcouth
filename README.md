## About

“Selcouth” is an old word meaning rare, unfamiliar, and wondrous—something seldom seen that invites curiosity. This spirit guides the project: we examine the whole human—body, mind, environment, and community—asking careful questions where easy answers are common.

The site organizes posts into clear topic pages with:
- Key takeaways
- Compact post cards (summaries and links)
- Sources and further reading
- A consistent disclaimer (educational only; not medical advice)
