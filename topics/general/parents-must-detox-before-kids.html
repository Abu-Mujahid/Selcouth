        <p><strong>Just a reminder:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Parents must detox for at least a year before having kids. Toxins and nutritional deficiencies do pass from parents to offspring.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Price emphasized that nutritional factors during prenatal development and childhood were crucial in determining whether genetic potential was fully realized. In his view, when parents followed nutrient-dense traditional diets, their children were more likely to develop strong bodies, good teeth, and overall vitality. Conversely, he argued that when modern, processed foods entered the diet, dental deformities, narrow faces, and susceptibility to disease became more prevalent over successive generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            He directly observed parents who ate a nutrient poor diet have children with facial deformities. However, if the children, who had dental deformities, returned to the native diet and way of life, their children would have fine facial development. So, toxicity and deficiencies can certainly be ‘passed down’ it is not due to genetic factors whatsoever. This points to the idea that genetic diseases do not exist.
