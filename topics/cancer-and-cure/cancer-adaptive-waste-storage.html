        <p>Cancer is not a disease to be feared. It is the body's garbage bag. All the toxins that we are being poisoned with are clogging up the elimination pathways of the body, from a lifetime of eating physical poisons and consuming mental poisons. Now, the body is creating a temporary garbage disposal bag, using which it prevents the poisons from damaging the rest of the body. This quarantined waste disposal bag is being called Cancer and is being labelled as a disease.</p>
        <p>Cancer is not a disease to be feared. It is an adaptive waste storage mechanism that your body uses to protect itself, in the hope that we will stop poisoning ourselves someday. When we stop poisoning ourselves and do what is necessary, like eating poison-free food and living in tune with nature, your body will first start cleaning the elimination pathways. Then, when the elimination pathways are working adequately, your body will start dumping the garbage from the waste storage bag that is being called Cancer.</p>
        <p>Cancer is just a symptom through which your body is announcing to you that you are leading a toxic life and need to correct your way of living. The language your body uses to whisper to you is symptoms. Your body now takes out a speaker called pain to talk to you, so that you listen. But, being the indoctrinated individuals we are, we don't bother to listen because we are too rooted in our ego to think that our indoctrination is knowledge and our body is stupid.</p>
        <p>Now, your body has no other choice but to take out a MegaPhone and make a deafening noise called Tumors and Cancers, so that we listen. If we don't listen and decide to poison ourselves even more using novel ways like Radiation, Chemotherapy, etc., our body understands that we have gone mental. It decides to leave the garbage dump that our body is because the stench is too much to live in.</p>
        <p>Maybe as humans, we should try living in garbage dumps to see how difficult we make it for our bodies to live inside our bodies and understand how difficult we are to live with.</p>
        <p>CANCER IS NOT A DISEASE. IT IS A SYMPTOM OF CONSUMING A LIFETIME OF POISONS. POISONS ARE THE ROOT CAUSE. CANCER IS THE EFFECT. As usual, our rulers conflate cause and effect to deceive us and divert us from the root cause of the problem, and we are misled enough to fall prey to it.</p>
        <p>Allopaths are just pawns in a much larger game who are misled enough not to question the illogical nonsense they have been taught using Rockefeller-controlled indoctrination masquerading as medical education.</p>
